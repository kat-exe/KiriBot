# KiriBot

Kiribot is a discord.py based discord bot. It posts random images and quotes from a database categorised by characters from media.
It is hosted on Replit and can run continuously via using a webserver and UptimeRobot to keep the bot online.

It has functionality for users to submit characters, images and quotes directly to the database with corresponding commands in discord,
and allows for a server admin to approve submissions before they are added into rotation. Functionality to edit and delete submissions 
after approval is not yet included but will be developed shortly.
